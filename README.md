## Description

The application asks the user to input the path of the folder and the name of the new folder. It then rearranges the files in the correct year/month/ folder.

This is ideal if you are lazy like me and store all your older photos in a single folder on your external HDD.

### Coming up...
- Support for other image formats
- Support for videos
- Sorting by location
